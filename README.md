# Simple Anagram Checker

An anagram is a word created from another word with the same letters but with different arrangements (e.g, maples and sample). This project simply compares two strings and determine if these can be anagrams of each other.

# Limitations
There is no validation if the strings are valid words. Hence, `sample1` and `1maples` would be anagrams.

# Usage
To run this project: simply clone the repository to your local machine, go to the directory and run `npm run start`.

    git clone https://github.com/jenorigor/anagram-checker.git
    cd anagram-checker
    npm run start
